# Adjoint of Matrices

## Introduction
The adjoint of a matrix is useful in many applications of linear algebra. The adjoint matrix, also known as the adjugate or classical adjoint, is connected to the concept of a matrix's inverse. In this lecture, we will look at the definition and properties of a matrix's adjoint, with an emphasis on 3x3 matrices.


## Definition
Let $A$ be a square matrix of order $n$. The adjoint of $A$, denoted as $\text{adj}(A)$ or $A^*$, is defined as the transpose of the cofactor matrix of $A$. The cofactor of an element $a_{ij}$ in $A$ is given by $C_{ij} = (-1)^{i+j}\det(M_{ij})$, where $M_{ij}$ is the $(n-1)\times(n-1)$ submatrix obtained by deleting the $i$-th row and $j$-th column of $A$. 

The adjoint matrix can be expressed as $\text{adj}(A) = [C_{ij}]^T$. In other words, the $(i,j)$-th entry of the adjoint matrix is the cofactor of the $(j,i)$-th entry of the original matrix.


<!-- Let $A$ be a 3x3 matrix with entries $a_{ij}$ for $1 \leq i,j \leq 3$. The adjoint of matrix $A$, denoted by $\text{adj}(A)$, is defined as the transpose of the cofactor matrix of $A$. The cofactor of the entry $a_{ij}$ is denoted by $C_{ij}$ and is defined as $(-1)^{i+j}$ times the determinant of the submatrix obtained by deleting the $i$th row and $j$th column of $A$. -->

## Illustration 2 x 2 matrices

Let's find the adjoint of the matrix $A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 1 & 4 \end{bmatrix}$.

\subsection{Step 1: Calculate the Cofactors}

The cofactors of matrix $A$ are obtained by taking the determinants of the 1x1 matrices formed by each element of $A$. Thus:

\[
C_{11} = (-1)^{1+1} \cdot \begin{vmatrix} 4 \end{vmatrix} = 4
\]
\[
C_{12} = (-1)^{1+2} \cdot \begin{vmatrix} 1 \end{vmatrix} = -1
\]
\[
C_{21} = (-1)^{2+1} \cdot \begin{vmatrix} 3 \end{vmatrix} = -3
\]
\[
C_{22} = (-1)^{2+2} \cdot \begin{vmatrix} 2 \end{vmatrix} = 2
\]

Thus, the cofactor matrix $\text{cof}(A)$ is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} 4 & -1 \\ -3 & 2 \end{bmatrix}
\]

\subsection{Step 2: Transpose the Cofactor Matrix}

The adjoint of matrix $A$ is obtained by taking the transpose of the cofactor matrix $\text{cof}(A)$. Thus, the adjoint $A^*$ is:

\[
A^* = \begin{bmatrix} 4 & -3 \\ -1 & 2 \end{bmatrix}
\]


## Illustration  3 x 3 matrices

Let's consider a 3x3 matrix $A$:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
    a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\
    a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\
    a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]

We can find the cofactor matrix of $A$ by computing the cofactors of each element:

\[
\text{cof}(A) = \begin{bmatrix}
    C_{11} & C_{12} & C_{13} \\
    C_{21} & C_{22} & C_{23} \\
    C_{31} & C_{32} & C_{33} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]

where,

\[
C_{ij} = (-1)^{i+j}\det(M_{ij})
\]

and $M_{ij}$ is the $(2\times2)$ submatrix obtained by deleting the $i$-th row and $j$-th column of $A$.

Finally, we take the transpose of the cofactor matrix to obtain the adjoint of $A$:

\[
\text{adj}(A) = \begin{bmatrix}
    C_{11} & C_{21} & C_{31} \\
    C_{12} & C_{22} & C_{32} \\
    C_{13} & C_{23} & C_{33} \\
\end{bmatrix}^T
\]



## Example
Let's find the adjoint of the following matrix:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
    2 & 3 & -1 \\
    0 & 4 & 2 \\
    1 & -3 & 5 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]

To find the cofactor matrix, we calculate the cofactor for each entry of matrix $A$:
\[
C_{11} = (-1)^{1+1} \begin{vmatrix}
    4 & 2 \\
    -3 & 5 \\
\end{vmatrix} = 26
\]

\[
C_{12} = (-1)^{1+2} \begin{vmatrix}
    0 & 2 \\
    1 & 5 \\
\end{vmatrix} = 2
\]

\[
C_{13} = (-1)^{1+3} \begin{vmatrix}
    0 & 4 \\
    1 & -3 \\
\end{vmatrix} = -4
\]

\[
C_{21} = (-1)^{2+1} \begin{vmatrix}
    3 & -1 \\
    -3 & 5 \\
\end{vmatrix} = -12
\]

\[
C_{22} = (-1)^{2+2} \begin{vmatrix}
    2 & -1 \\
    1 & 5 \\
\end{vmatrix} = 11
\]

\[
C_{23} = (-1)^{2+3} \begin{vmatrix}
    2 & 3 \\
    1 & -3 \\
\end{vmatrix} = 9
\]

\[
C_{31} = (-1)^{3+1} \begin{vmatrix}
    3 & -1 \\
    4 & 2 \\
\end{vmatrix} = 10
\]

\[
C_{32} = (-1)^{3+2} \begin{vmatrix}
    2 & -1 \\
    0 & 2 \\
\end{vmatrix} = -4
\]

\[
C_{33} = (-1)^{3+3} \begin{vmatrix}
    2 & 3 \\
    0 & 4 \\
\end{vmatrix} = 8
\]

The cofactor matrix is given by:
\[
\text{cof}(A) = \begin{bmatrix}
    26 & 2 & -4 \\
    -12 & 11 & 9 \\
    10 & -4 & 8 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Finally, we take the transpose of the cofactor matrix to obtain the adjoint of matrix $A$:
\[
\text{adj}(A) = \begin{bmatrix}
    26 & -12 & 10 \\
    2 & 11 & -4 \\
    -4 & 9 & 8 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]

## Properties of the Adjoint
The adjoint of a matrix has several properties:

1. If $A$ is an invertible matrix, then $\text{adj}(A)$ is also invertible, and $(\text{adj}(A))^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det(A)}A$.

2. If $A$ is a symmetric matrix, then $\text{adj}(A) = A$.
3. If $A$ and $B$ are matrices of the same size, then $\text{adj}(AB) = \text{adj}(B) \cdot \text{adj}(A)$.

<!-- \begin{itemize} -->
<!--     \item If $A$ is invertible, then $\text{adj}(A)$ is given by $\text{adj}(A) = \frac{1}{\det(A)}\text{cof}(A)$. -->
<!--     \item The product of a matrix $A$ and its adjoint $\text{adj}(A)$ is a scalar multiple of the determinant of $A$: $A\cdot \text{adj}(A) = \det(A)I$, where $I$ is the identity matrix. -->
<!--     \item If $A$ is invertible, then $A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det(A)}\text{adj}(A)$. -->
<!-- \end{itemize} -->


## Conclusion
A matrix's adjoint contains useful information about the original matrix, such as its invertibility and the relationship between the matrix and its determinant. We focused on the definition and properties of the adjoint of 2x2 and 3x3 matrices in this lesson. However, the adjoint idea can be used to matrices of any order. Further study of this subject will broaden your grasp of linear algebra and its applications.
