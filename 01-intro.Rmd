# Introduction
This course is an introduction to linear algebra. We will cover the following topics: vector spaces given by solutions to linear systems; linear independence; dimension; determinants; eigenvalues and eigenvectors; diagonalization; and complex numbers.  

## Textbook
The recommended textbook is Linear Algebra and its Applications (6th Edition) by D. Lay, S. Lay, and J. McDonald. The 5th Edition will equally work fine
